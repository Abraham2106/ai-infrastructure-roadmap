## Overview

This repository documents a learning-by-doing journey toward becoming a **Cloud / Platform Engineer**, with a long-term goal of working on **AI and LLM Infrastructure**.

This is not a fixed roadmap. It is an evolutionary process — goals, scope, and structure will change as engineering foundations mature.

The intention is to **build real engineering intuition**, not to accumulate tools or buzzwords.

## Phases

Each phase has its own document with objectives, scope, and a progress checklist.

| Phase | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Phase 1 — Weeks 1–2](./docs/phases/phase-01.md) | Foundations before tools | In progress |
| Phase 2 — Weeks 3–6 | Cloud fundamentals & basic DevOps | Pending |
| Phase 3 — Later | Platform patterns, automation, observability | Pending |
| Phase 4 — Future | MLOps & AI Infrastructure | Pending |

## Philosophy

- Depth over speed
- Understanding before tooling
- Systems over syntax
- Clarity over completeness

This repository reflects how engineers actually grow: incrementally, with revisions, corrections, and better questions over time.

## Note

If something here looks basic, incomplete, or temporary — that is by design.

This repository captures progress, not perfection.
